# C304 - Compiler Design

This repository contains my lab/assignment solutions for the compiler design course [COMP304 - Spring '25](https://github.com/m-fakhry/comp304-24-25/) + some other self studying goodies

## Compiler Design Topics 2 learn:

1.  **Lexical Analysis (Scanning)**
2.  **Syntax Analysis (Parsing)**
3.  **Semantic Analysis**
4.  **Intermediate Code Generation**
5.  **Code Optimization**
6.  **Code Generation**

(probably not going to be covering the optimization and generation parts in uni)
